      <h1>TAKING ROOT</h1>
      <p>Taking Root is a 3D platformer created in Unreal Engine 5. Gameplay consists of the player jumping over obstacles and dodging hazards while trying to escape out of a kitchen which was on fire. The main mechanics was that the player character could root themselves to the ground, which was important because an air conditioner would periodically turn on and push the player backwards whilst a wall of fire slowly chased them across the kitchen countertop.</p>
      <p>This project was done as a part of the 2023 global game jam, where teams had 48 hours to create a project that related to the theme of “Roots”. My role for this project was as a game designer in a team of 8, where I handled the design, blueprints and implementation of certain game mechanics.</p>

      <h1>NEVERGREEN</h1>
      <p>Nevergreen is a visual novel that was created as a part of the Panivox narrative game jam where participants had to create a game in a software called “Richcast” that tackled serious issues in the timeframe of two weeks. Our project chose to focus on two animals escaping deforestation where they must reach a raft in time which would take them to a new home. However, they would run into different animals in destress and the player would have the choice of helping or leaving them, if the player helps then it will take up time and may risk them missing the raft.</p>
      <p>In this project I worked as a narrative and game designer in a team of 4.</p>
